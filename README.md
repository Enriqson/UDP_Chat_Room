# UDP_Chat_Room

### Project is divided in 3 parts:

#### Part 1: 
Simple file transfer using UDP.

#### Part 2: 
Reliable file transfer using UDP, according to the RDT 3.0 protocol.

#### Part 3: 
Reliable chat room.

PS: Not recommended to be used in the ipynb format as the kernel scheduler may lead to time-related errors.

PS 2: I'm aware there might be some bugs, specially in the third part, as there wasn't enough time to thoroughly test the code before the date it was due.
